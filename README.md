# Model--and-Learning-based-Approaches-to-CT-Reconstruction-
Implementation and comparision of neural networks for CT reconstruction using simulated data on the MNIST data set.
           Tomographic reconstruction is the process of reconstruction of 2 or 3 dimensional
images from the 1 dimensional slices of the object.The objective of this paper is to
use Deep neural networks in Medical Imaging for tomographic reconstruction of
images from the set of X-ray projections.This work draws a comparison of deep
learning approach in Tomographic reconstruction with the traditional reconstruction
methods such as Pseudoinverse, Filtered Back Projection(FBP), Iterative algorithms.
It aims for reconstruction technique with the usage of less number of hazardous
X-ray projections.
